## Task conditions ##

- Develop a program to calculate the shortest path for a mail drone to fly. The
drone starts from the post office, flies around all the recipients once to
deliver the parcels and returns to the post office. Destination map with points
and its coordinates set. Ones need to find the shortest route to fly around.

- Destination map:    
![Destination map](ADDS/addresses_map.png)

- Point coordinates:

    ```text
    1. Post office – (0, 2)
    2. Griboedov Str., 104/25 – (2, 5)
    3. Baker Str., 221b – (5, 2)
    4. Bolshaya Sadovaya Str., 302-bis – (6, 6)
    5. Vechnozelyonaya alley, 742 – (8, 3)
    ```

- The result must contain a sequence of points, which make up the shortest of
the routes with the output of intermediate distances for each point (from the
start to the current point) and the total length of the route.
